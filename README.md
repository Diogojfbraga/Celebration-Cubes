# Confetti's Cube Generator

This project is a visually dynamic cube generator with added confetti effects. The cubes are arranged in a grid, and their heights, colors, and movements are controlled by sliders. Additionally, confetti elements fall and rotate around the scene, adding a festive touch.

## Features
- **Interactive Sliders:** Adjustable sliders for controlling cube height, cube speed, and camera position, providing users with the ability to customize the visual experience.
- **Grid of Dynamic Cubes:** Cubes are arranged in a grid pattern, with their heights and colors influenced by sinusoidal functions and user-controlled sliders.
- **Dynamic Camera Movement:** The camera position is controlled by a slider, allowing users to change the perspective and explore the cube grid from different angles.
- **Confetti Animation:** Colorful confetti elements fall from the top, adding a playful and festive element to the scene. The confetti's rotation and color are dynamically generated.

## How It Works
1. **Slider Controls:**
    - Cube Height: Adjust the height of the cubes in the grid.
    - Cube Speed: Control the speed of the height change animation of the cubes.
    - Camera Position: Change the position of the camera to explore the cube grid from different angles.

2. **Grid of Dynamic Cubes:**
    - Cubes are arranged in a grid pattern.
    - Cube height is influenced by sinusoidal functions, providing dynamic visual effects.

3. **Camera and Lighting:**
    - The camera position is dynamically controlled, allowing users to explore the cube grid.
    - Directional, point, and spotlight sources contribute to the lighting effects.

4. **Confetti Animation:**
    - Colorful confetti elements fall from the top of the canvas.
    - Confetti elements rotate and change color dynamically, creating a festive atmosphere.
    - Confetti elements reset when reaching the bottom, ensuring a continuous animation.

## Instructions
- Use the sliders to interactively control cube height, cube speed, and camera position.
- Observe the dynamic changes in the cube grid, including the confetti animation.
- Experiment with different slider values to create unique visual patterns and perspectives.
